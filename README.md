# Conway-s-game-of-life
A simulation of the famous Conway's game of life I made for fun using Pygame.

If you want to look up what is conway's game of life or how it works i suggest checking the wikipedia page - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life.

Here are the neccesary controls for the version i made-
1) Initiallly you'll see paused and building in the upper left corner.
2) These can be changed using space bar and the key 'K' for pause state. And the key 'B' for the build state. 
3) You can build initial setup while it is in pause state.
4) When build state is on, you can drag mouse to build freely. And destroying is similar for destroying.

Theoretically, Conway's game has a infinite board.
But of course due to screen constraints, we have limited space to work with so I have tried to make the cells small to make a lot of them. If you want, you can change the cell size parameter in the source file to get more cells but i wouldn't recommend that as it worsens the experience.

Thank You
